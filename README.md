A collection of applescripts that may or may not be useful.

The scripts currently provided help automate cleanup tasks in [Microsoft Outlook 2011 for Mac][1]. It really bugs me that attachments in emails are most often user signatures that insist upon using [PNGs, GIFs, or god forbid JPEGs][2] for logos or other advertising making scanning emails for the one with that important attachment more difficult. If this doesn't immediately make sense to you and you need more convincing please read [Why email signatures are dumb][3]. If you are going to ignore that advice and send mails with signatures please make the images HTML IMG tags so they aren't taking up space and falsely registering as attachments. [How to Create HTML Email Signatures for Microsoft Outlook 2011 On a Mac][4].

The script will create a folder under documents that will allow you to drop any old attachment into the folder and in the future you run the script and it will roll through your folders removing all attachments that match the files hash signature.
